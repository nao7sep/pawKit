# AI Code Generation Rules

This directory contains rules and guidelines for AI-assisted generation of code, comments, and documentation in the pawKitLib project. All AI agents and tools must refer to these rules before generating or modifying any code, comments, or documentation to ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability.

---

- Place one rule or closely related set of rules per file.
- Use clear, imperative language (e.g., "Always...", "Never...", "Prefer...").
- Rules should be concise and actionable.
- Update or add new rules as project needs evolve.

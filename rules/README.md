# AI Code Generation Rules

This directory contains rules and guidelines for AI-assisted code generation in the pawKitLib project. All AI agents and tools must refer to these rules before generating or modifying code.

---

- Place one rule or tightly related set of rules per file.
- Use clear, imperative language (e.g., "Always...", "Never...", "Prefer...").
- Rules should be concise and actionable.
- Update or add new rules as project needs evolve.

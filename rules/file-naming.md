# File Naming

These rules apply only to file and directory names in the repository:

- Use `lowercase-with-hyphens` for all documentation, markdown, and general-purpose files (e.g., `implementation-plan.md`).
- Use `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` only for special files that are universally recognized (e.g., `README.md`, `LICENSE`).

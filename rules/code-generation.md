# Code Generation

## 1. Production-Ready Output
- All generated code and comments must be ready for production.
- Only include comments that clarify intent or usage for future maintainers.
- Do not include explanatory/process comments (e.g., "added for...", "commented out to...").

## 2. Placement and Structure
- Place new elements (methods, parameters, items) precisely where they belong within the code structure.
- Do not simply append to the end unless that is the correct and conventional location.

## 3. Refactoring and Clarity
- Refactor, reorder, or reconstruct code sections as needed for clarity and maintainability.
- Prioritize code quality and readability over minimizing the size of the change.

## 4. No Manual Cleanup Required
- Generated code should not require further manual cleanup or reorganization.
- Deliver results as close as possible to what would be committed after a thorough human review.

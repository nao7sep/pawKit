# AI Code Generation Quality Rules

- All code and comments generated must be ready for production: write only what a developer would expect to see in a final, reviewed commit. Explanatory or process comments (such as "added for..." or "commented out to...") should not be included. Only include comments that clarify intent or usage for future maintainers.

- When adding or modifying code, place new elements—such as methods, parameters, or items—precisely where they belong within the structure. Do not simply append to the end unless that is the correct and conventional location.

- If a better structure or improved clarity requires reordering, refactoring, or reconstructing a section of code, make those changes as needed, provided the result remains correct and maintainable. Prioritize code quality and readability over minimizing the size of the change.

- Generated code should not require further manual cleanup or reorganization. Deliver results that are as close as possible to what would be committed after a thorough human review.

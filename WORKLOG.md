## [2025-05-18] Initial Specification Generation

**Context:**
- The design and requirements for pawKitLib were discussed and saved as a conversation log (file archived securely).
- The conversation was split into detailed topics, resulting in the creation of `specs/topics-and-details.md` as a table of contents, and 18 topic-specific specification documents in the `specs/` directory.

**Topics and Corresponding Documents:**

1. **Logging Infrastructure**
   File: `specs/logging-infrastructure.md`
   _Minimal, configurable, dependency-free logging system for .NET, with optional adapters._

2. **Configuration and Settings Management**
   File: `specs/configuration-and-settings-management.md`
   _Flexible, JSON-backed configuration with type conversion helpers and no ambient defaults._

3. **Type Conversion Utilities**
   File: `specs/type-conversion-utilities.md`
   _Centralized helpers for converting between strings and common .NET types._

4. **Exception Management and Serialization**
   File: `specs/exception-management-and-serialization.md`
   _Structured, thread-safe exception capture, filtering, and JSON serialization._

5. **Path and File System Safety**
   File: `specs/path-and-file-system-safety.md`
   _Unified, cross-platform path abstraction and safe file/directory operations._

6. **Dynamic Data and Flexible Value Wrappers**
   File: `specs/dynamic-data-and-flexible-value-wrappers.md`
   _Type-safe wrappers for dynamic, loosely-typed, or schema-less data._

7. **Exception Class Design and Usage**
   File: `specs/exception-class-design-and-usage.md`
   _Guidelines for custom exception hierarchy and usage in pawKitLib._

8. **Process and Command Line Utilities**
   File: `specs/process-and-command-line-utilities.md`
   _Cross-platform command line parsing and process utilities._

9. **String Manipulation and Formatting**
   File: `specs/string-manipulation-and-formatting.md`
   _Centralized utilities for multi-line and content-aware string processing._

10. **Time Abstraction and Time Zone Handling**
    File: `specs/time-abstraction-and-time-zone-handling.md`
    _Interfaces and helpers for UTC/local time, time zones, and testable clocks._

11. **Validation Framework**
    File: `specs/validation-framework.md`
    _Fluent, testable validation engine with built-in and extensible rules._

12. **ID Generation**
    File: `specs/id-generation.md`
    _Centralized, extensible utilities for generating and parsing unique IDs._

13. **Hashing Utilities**
    File: `specs/hashing-utilities.md`
    _Purpose-driven, extensible APIs for hashing strings, files, and streams._

14. **Localization**
    File: `specs/localization.md`
    _APIs for localizing strings/resources, dynamic language switching, and fallbacks._

15. **Namespace and Project Structure**
    File: `specs/namespace-and-project-structure.md`
    _Defines namespaces, folder structure, and modularization strategy._

16. **Email Abstraction and Sending**
    File: `specs/email-abstraction-and-sending.md`
    _Interface-driven email sending with dev/test implementations and no core dependencies._

17. **SQLite/EF Core as Pluggable Storage**
    File: `specs/pluggable-storage-backends.md`
    _Optional, modular support for SQLite/EF Core as storage backends._

18. **WebAssembly/Blazor Support Policy**
    File: `specs/webassembly-blazor-support-policy.md`
    _Policy and guidance for Wasm/Blazor compatibility and modularization._

**Note:**
- The order of topics matches the current `topics-and-details.md` and may change as topics are added or removed in the future.
- Each topic is covered in a dedicated specification file, ensuring no gaps from the original design conversation.
- Update this log with a new dated entry for future changes, additions, or major document revisions.

## AI Instructions for Adding New Log Entries

*Instructions for AI assistants on how to add entries to this work log. These instructions are preserved when creating new version logs because you'll forget the format otherwise.*

### Entry Format Requirements

**Header Format:**
- Use level 3 heading (`###`) with format: `YYYY-MM-DD - [What Actually Got Done]`
- Date must be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) - this isn't rocket science
- Title should describe what was accomplished, not what was attempted
- Add horizontal rule (`---`) before each entry

**Required Sections:**
1. **Summary:** What actually got built, not what was discussed
   - Focus on concrete deliverables: files created, classes implemented, bugs fixed
   - Be specific about what changed - "refactored UserService" is useless
   - Include quantifiable details - "Added 5 test classes" not "improved test coverage"
   - No fluff about "exploring options" or "considering approaches"

2. **Key Architectural Decisions:** Design choices that matter
   - Document why you chose approach X over Y
   - Reference which design principles from `FOUNDATIONS.md` were applied (or violated)
   - Note deviations from standards and justify them
   - Use "N/A" if no significant decisions were made (rare but honest)

### Content Guidelines

**Writing Style:**
- Past tense for completed work - if it's not done, don't log it
- Be factual and brutal - avoid diplomatic language
- Focus on outcomes, not the journey of discovery
- Keep entries dense with information, light on narrative

**Technical Details:**
- Reference specific interfaces, classes, and namespaces - be precise
- Mention adherence to design principles or document violations
- Note use of community standards vs. custom implementations
- Document test coverage - actual numbers, not feelings

**Cross-References:**
- Link to relevant files using relative paths
- Reference specific line numbers when discussing code changes
- Mention related entries when work builds on previous sessions

### Entry Placement

- **Always add new entries at the top** of the "Development Log Entries" section
- Maintain reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Each entry separated by horizontal rule (`---`)

### 2025-07-13 - Purged All AI Code to Correct Catastrophic Premature Generalization

**Summary:**
- Deleted the entire `pawKitLib.Ai` namespace and all provider implementations. This action was taken to correct a complete failure in development discipline.
- The previous implementation was a textbook case of premature generalization, resulting in a "DTO explosion"—a useless collection of dozens of data transfer objects that modeled an external API without serving a single concrete feature.
- This reset establishes a new, non-negotiable directive: development will be strictly driven by the YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principle. No code will be written unless it is required for the immediate, end-to-end implementation of a specific feature.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Rejection of Premature Abstraction:** The "build a complete SDK first" approach is officially declared an anti-pattern for this project. It resulted in wasted effort, unnecessary complexity, and zero delivered value. Blaming a tool for suggesting possibilities is an admission of a lack of critical thought.
- **YAGNI as a Core Principle:** All future AI-related development will start with the simplest possible use case (e.g., text-in, text-out). The domain model will evolve incrementally and organically as, and only as, new features demand it. This prevents building solutions for imaginary problems.
- **Focus on Value Delivery:** The primary goal is to build working software, not to create a perfect, abstract model of an external system. This purge serves as a permanent reminder to focus on concrete deliverables over architectural navel-gazing.

### 2025-07-12 - Refactored `OpenAiClient` for SRP and Robustness

**Summary:**
- Executed a critical refactoring of the `OpenAiClient` to correct a severe violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- Extracted all complex mapping logic from the client into a new, dedicated `OpenAiMapper` static utility class.
- Systematically enforced project conventions by reorganizing all provider-specific Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) into a dedicated `Dto` sub-namespace, cleaning up the provider's root directory.
- Identified and fixed a critical bug where the `OpenAiChatCompletionRequest` DTO was missing numerous properties, rendering large parts of the `InferenceParameters` unusable.
- Hardened the `HandleErrorResponseAsync` method to provide more detailed error messages when the API returns non-JSON error payloads, preventing silent failures during debugging.
- Resolved multiple compile errors and type mismatches that arose during the refactoring, including a `LogitBias` type conversion from the abstract `int` to the provider-specific `float`.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The primary driver for this work was to enforce SRP. The `OpenAiClient` was incorrectly responsible for both HTTP communication and complex object mapping. Separating these into `OpenAiClient` and `OpenAiMapper` respectively makes the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** The file reorganization into a `Dto` subfolder was a direct application of SoC, separating data contracts (the "what") from operational code (the "how"). This aligns the provider's structure with established project conventions and improves clarity.
- **Robustness and Fail-Fast:** The error handling was improved to be more robust. Instead of silently swallowing a `JsonException`, the raw error content is now included in the exception message. This follows a "fail-fast" philosophy, providing crucial context for debugging API integration issues instead of hiding them.

### 2025-07-11 - Architectural Refactoring of the Core AI Domain Model

**Summary:**
- Executed a comprehensive architectural refactoring of the entire `pawKitLib.Ai` namespace, correcting widespread violations of the Separation of Concerns principle.
- Dismantled the flat, disorganized file structure and replaced it with a logical hierarchy of sub-namespaces: `Content`, `Tools`, `Streaming`, `Requests`, and `Sessions`.
- Relocated over 20 files to their correct directories and updated their namespaces to enforce the "namespace must match folder structure" convention.
- Systematically updated all dependent files with corrected `using` statements to reflect the new architecture.
- The `pawKitLib.Ai.Sessions` namespace is now correctly isolated to contain only types representing persistent conversation state (`AiSession`, `AiMessage`).
- The `pawKitLib.Ai.Requests` namespace was created to house transient, per-request data contracts (`InferenceParameters`, `AiRequestContext`).
- All other core data models were organized into their respective `Content`, `Tools`, and `Streaming` namespaces.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** This was the primary driver. The refactoring strictly separated persistent session state from transient request data, message content definitions, tool definitions, and streaming data chunks. This corrected the initial architectural flaw where all types were incorrectly mixed in the root `Ai` and `Sessions` namespaces.
- **Namespace and Folder Parity:** The refactoring rigorously enforced the convention that namespaces must mirror the folder structure. This resolved the previous chaos, significantly improving code discoverability and maintainability.
- **Clarity over Convenience:** The initial anti-pattern of grouping "related" types in a single file or namespace was systematically dismantled. The new structure favors a clear, single-responsibility organization, which is a foundational principle of the project.

### 2025-07-11 - Implemented `OpenAiClient` and Finalized Core Service Architecture

**Summary:**
- Implemented the first concrete `IAiClient`, the `OpenAiClient`, providing a production-ready client for the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
- Created a full suite of internal, provider-specific DTOs to accurately model the OpenAI API for requests (including tools, multi-modal content, and all inference parameters) and responses (including structured errors).
- Implemented the complete, non-streaming request/response lifecycle:
    - Complex mapping logic from the library's abstract models to the OpenAI-specific format.
    - HTTP POST request execution using `HttpClient`.
    - Robust, structured error handling that deserializes the provider's error payload into a custom `OpenAiApiException`.
    - Response mapping from the provider's format back to the library's abstract `AiMessage`.
- Designed the `IStreamingAiClient` interface and a robust, type-safe `StreamingPart` discriminated union for future streaming implementation. The streaming model was redesigned for improved usability and to include critical features like token usage reporting.
- Refactored the `OpenAiClient` for maintainability and robustness by centralizing all magic strings into an `OpenAiApiConstants` class and adding comprehensive XML documentation to all internal mapping logic.
- Standardized the library's configuration pattern by reverting `ResourceResolver` to use `IOptions<T>`, ensuring consistency with `OpenAiClient`. Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to document both DI-based and manual usage of this pattern.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Provider-Specific Isolation (SoC):** All OpenAI-specific models and logic were strictly isolated in the `pawKitLib.Ai.Providers.OpenAI` namespace, preventing provider details from leaking into the core abstractions.
- **Contract-Driven Development (ISP):** Rejected adding parameters (`stream`, `n`) that would break the `IAiClient` contract. A new, dedicated `IStreamingAiClient` interface was designed instead, keeping contracts focused and honest.
- **Robustness and Maintainability:** Replaced lazy error handling (`EnsureSuccessStatusCode`) with a structured mechanism that provides clear, actionable error details to the consumer. Eradicated magic strings to make the client less brittle and easier to maintain.
- **Architectural Consistency:** Re-aligned the configuration pattern for all services to use `IOptions<T>`. This decision was made to enforce a single, standard way of handling configuration, and the `ARCHITECTURE.md` was updated to demystify the pattern and demonstrate its flexibility for consumers not using a full DI container.

### 2025-07-11 - Implemented Foundational Services and Mock Client

**Summary:**
- Implemented the core request preparation services: `ResourceResolver` and `RequestContextBuilder`.
- The `ResourceResolver` was built to be secure by default, enforcing a strict `allowedBasePath` to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. The design was refactored to accept this path directly via constructor, removing the heavy `IOptions<T>` dependency for improved usability in non-DI scenarios.
- The `RequestContextBuilder` was implemented to correctly apply all session rules, including context overrides and system prompt overrides, to generate a clean `AiRequestContext`. The implementation was refactored to improve performance on the common path (text-only messages) and to robustly handle multi-part system prompts.
- The `IAiClient` interface was refactored to accept the prepared `AiRequestContext`, decoupling it from the builder and clarifying the library's data flow.
- Created a `MockAiClient` to serve as a test double and example implementation, allowing for isolated testing of the entire request pipeline.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Security First:** The `ResourceResolver`'s path traversal vulnerability was identified and fixed by enforcing a mandatory security boundary (`allowedBasePath`). The initial "fix" using `IOptions<T>` was rejected as overly complex, and a simpler, direct constructor injection was chosen to balance security with usability.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** The data flow was clarified by refining the `IAiClient` contract. The `RequestContextBuilder` is now solely responsible for content preparation, and the `IAiClient` is solely responsible for API protocol translation. This is a textbook application of SoC and DIP.
- **Pragmatic Performance:** The `RequestContextBuilder` was refactored to avoid unnecessary async overhead for text-only messages, optimizing for the most common use case without adding undue complexity.
- **Testability:** The creation of `MockAiClient` as the first implementation of `IAiClient` establishes a critical pattern for testable development. It ensures that the core logic can be validated without reliance on external services.

### 2025-07-11 - AI Session Data Model and Abstractions Design

**Summary:**
- Designed and finalized the complete set of immutable data models for multi-modal AI sessions under the `pawKitLib.Ai` and `pawKitLib.Ai.Sessions` namespaces.
- Created foundational types: `IContentPart`, `Modality`, `ResourceRef`, `ResourceKind`, and concrete content parts (`TextContentPart`, `MediaContentPart`, `JsonContentPart`).
- Implemented a comprehensive session model (`AiSession`, `AiMessage`, `MessageRole`) supporting conversation history, tool definitions, metadata, and context overrides for cost management.
- Designed a robust `InferenceParameters` record to handle request-time configuration (e.g., `temperature`, `modelId`, `toolChoice`, `responseFormat`) separately from the persistent session log.
- Defined the primary behavioral contract for the library, `IAiClient`, in the new `pawKitLib.Ai.Abstractions` namespace.
- Established and documented the core architectural pattern for UI consumption (the ViewModel Adapter Pattern) in a new `ARCHITECTURE.md` file.
- Refactored all new types to use `System.Collections.Immutable` collections for performance and correctness.
- Performed multiple code quality audits to ensure compliance with `CONVENTIONS.md` and `REFACTORING.md`, fixing member ordering, documentation, and file encoding issues.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Immutability First:** All DTOs (`AiSession`, `AiMessage`) were designed as immutable `record` types using `ImmutableList<T>` to ensure thread safety and predictable state management, per `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):**
    - Separated foundational content types (`pawKitLib.Ai`) from session-specific structural types (`pawKitLib.Ai.Sessions`).
    - Decoupled persistent session state (`AiSession`) from transient request configuration (`InferenceParameters`). This prevents polluting the session log with ephemeral settings.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
    - Defined `IAiClient` as the core abstraction, ensuring high-level modules depend on this contract, not on concrete provider implementations.
    - Decoupled `ResponseFormat` from provider-specific string literals, making the domain model provider-agnostic. The responsibility for translation is pushed to the concrete client implementation.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
    - Added a `Metadata` dictionary to `AiSession` to allow for extension with application-specific data without modifying the core library.
- **Pragmatic Design:**
    - Rejected redundant specific media types (e.g., `ImageContentPart`) in favor of a generic `MediaContentPart` that uses the `Modality` enum, avoiding type explosion.
    - Documented the `ViewModel Adapter Pattern` in `ARCHITECTURE.md` to explicitly guide consumers on how to correctly use the immutable model in stateful UI applications, preventing common architectural mistakes.

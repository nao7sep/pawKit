## AI Instructions for Adding New Log Entries

*Instructions for AI assistants on how to add entries to this work log. These instructions are preserved when creating new version logs because you'll forget the format otherwise.*

### Entry Format Requirements

**Header Format:**
- Use level 3 heading (`###`) with format: `YYYY-MM-DD - [What Actually Got Done]`
- Date must be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) - this isn't rocket science
- Title should describe what was accomplished, not what was attempted
- Add horizontal rule (`---`) before each entry

**Required Sections:**
1. **Summary:** What actually got built, not what was discussed
   - Focus on concrete deliverables: files created, classes implemented, bugs fixed
   - Be specific about what changed - "refactored UserService" is useless
   - Include quantifiable details - "Added 5 test classes" not "improved test coverage"
   - No fluff about "exploring options" or "considering approaches"

2. **Key Architectural Decisions:** Design choices that matter
   - Document why you chose approach X over Y
   - Reference which design principles from `FOUNDATIONS.md` were applied (or violated)
   - Note deviations from standards and justify them
   - Use "N/A" if no significant decisions were made (rare but honest)

### Content Guidelines

**Writing Style:**
- Past tense for completed work - if it's not done, don't log it
- Be factual and brutal - avoid diplomatic language
- Focus on outcomes, not the journey of discovery
- Keep entries dense with information, light on narrative

**Technical Details:**
- Reference specific interfaces, classes, and namespaces - be precise
- Mention adherence to design principles or document violations
- Note use of community standards vs. custom implementations
- Document test coverage - actual numbers, not feelings

**Cross-References:**
- Link to relevant files using relative paths
- Reference specific line numbers when discussing code changes
- Mention related entries when work builds on previous sessions

### Entry Placement

- **Always add new entries at the top** of the "Development Log Entries" section
- Maintain reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Each entry separated by horizontal rule (`---`)

### 2025-07-11 - Implemented Foundational Services and Mock Client

**Summary:**
- Implemented the core request preparation services: `ResourceResolver` and `RequestContextBuilder`.
- The `ResourceResolver` was built to be secure by default, enforcing a strict `allowedBasePath` to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. The design was refactored to accept this path directly via constructor, removing the heavy `IOptions<T>` dependency for improved usability in non-DI scenarios.
- The `RequestContextBuilder` was implemented to correctly apply all session rules, including context overrides and system prompt overrides, to generate a clean `AiRequestContext`. The implementation was refactored to improve performance on the common path (text-only messages) and to robustly handle multi-part system prompts.
- The `IAiClient` interface was refactored to accept the prepared `AiRequestContext`, decoupling it from the builder and clarifying the library's data flow.
- Created a `MockAiClient` to serve as a test double and example implementation, allowing for isolated testing of the entire request pipeline.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Security First:** The `ResourceResolver`'s path traversal vulnerability was identified and fixed by enforcing a mandatory security boundary (`allowedBasePath`). The initial "fix" using `IOptions<T>` was rejected as overly complex, and a simpler, direct constructor injection was chosen to balance security with usability.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** The data flow was clarified by refining the `IAiClient` contract. The `RequestContextBuilder` is now solely responsible for content preparation, and the `IAiClient` is solely responsible for API protocol translation. This is a textbook application of SoC and DIP.
- **Pragmatic Performance:** The `RequestContextBuilder` was refactored to avoid unnecessary async overhead for text-only messages, optimizing for the most common use case without adding undue complexity.
- **Testability:** The creation of `MockAiClient` as the first implementation of `IAiClient` establishes a critical pattern for testable development. It ensures that the core logic can be validated without reliance on external services.

### 2025-07-11 - AI Session Data Model and Abstractions Design

**Summary:**
- Designed and finalized the complete set of immutable data models for multi-modal AI sessions under the `pawKitLib.Ai` and `pawKitLib.Ai.Sessions` namespaces.
- Created foundational types: `IContentPart`, `Modality`, `ResourceRef`, `ResourceKind`, and concrete content parts (`TextContentPart`, `MediaContentPart`, `JsonContentPart`).
- Implemented a comprehensive session model (`AiSession`, `AiMessage`, `MessageRole`) supporting conversation history, tool definitions, metadata, and context overrides for cost management.
- Designed a robust `InferenceParameters` record to handle request-time configuration (e.g., `temperature`, `modelId`, `toolChoice`, `responseFormat`) separately from the persistent session log.
- Defined the primary behavioral contract for the library, `IAiClient`, in the new `pawKitLib.Ai.Abstractions` namespace.
- Established and documented the core architectural pattern for UI consumption (the ViewModel Adapter Pattern) in a new `ARCHITECTURE.md` file.
- Refactored all new types to use `System.Collections.Immutable` collections for performance and correctness.
- Performed multiple code quality audits to ensure compliance with `CONVENTIONS.md` and `REFACTORING.md`, fixing member ordering, documentation, and file encoding issues.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Immutability First:** All DTOs (`AiSession`, `AiMessage`) were designed as immutable `record` types using `ImmutableList<T>` to ensure thread safety and predictable state management, per `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):**
    - Separated foundational content types (`pawKitLib.Ai`) from session-specific structural types (`pawKitLib.Ai.Sessions`).
    - Decoupled persistent session state (`AiSession`) from transient request configuration (`InferenceParameters`). This prevents polluting the session log with ephemeral settings.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
    - Defined `IAiClient` as the core abstraction, ensuring high-level modules depend on this contract, not on concrete provider implementations.
    - Decoupled `ResponseFormat` from provider-specific string literals, making the domain model provider-agnostic. The responsibility for translation is pushed to the concrete client implementation.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
    - Added a `Metadata` dictionary to `AiSession` to allow for extension with application-specific data without modifying the core library.
- **Pragmatic Design:**
    - Rejected redundant specific media types (e.g., `ImageContentPart`) in favor of a generic `MediaContentPart` that uses the `Modality` enum, avoiding type explosion.
    - Documented the `ViewModel Adapter Pattern` in `ARCHITECTURE.md` to explicitly guide consumers on how to correctly use the immutable model in stateful UI applications, preventing common architectural mistakes.

Simple Windows-Compatible Filename Creation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generate a filename from the given document title with the following requirements:
1. Avoid characters not allowed in Windows filenames.
2. Use only lowercase letters unless capitalization is strictly necessary (e.g., acronyms or proper names).
3. Replace spaces, other separators, and special symbols with hyphens or appropriate textual equivalents (for example, convert 'C#' to 'csharp').
4. Keep the filename as close to the original title as possible (no shortening or additional modifications beyond removing invalid characters).

Document Header Insertion (UTC Timestamp)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insert a header at the very beginning of the document, and ensure there is one empty line after the header before the document content begins.
The header must be the current UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format:
<!-- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ -->

Comprehensive C# Technology Document
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a detailed document covering a specific technology or package, focusing on C# usage.
Include thorough explanations, best practices, and illustrative sample C# code.

1. Insert a UTC Timestamp Header:
   At the very top of the document, add a header with the current UTC time in ISO 8601 format:
   <!-- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ -->

2. Generate a Windows-Compatible Filename:
   After writing the document, create a filename based on the document's title by adhering to these rules:
   - Avoid any characters not permitted in Windows filenames.
   - Use only lowercase letters unless capitalization is strictly necessary (for example, acronyms or proper names).
   - Replace spaces and other separators with hyphens.
   - Also, replace special symbols with their textual equivalents (for example, C# should be converted to csharp).
   - Keep the filename as close to the original title as possible (do not shorten or overly modify it).

3. Save the Document:
   Conclude by saving the document under the generated filename.
   Ensure the file ends with a newline.

Purposeful Code Commenting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When reviewing or writing code, apply these commenting principles:

1. Add comments only when the code could be confusing or misleading without explanation.
2. Avoid redundant comments that merely restate what the code already clearly expresses.
3. All sentence-type comments must end with an appropriate punctuation symbol (period, question mark, or exclamation point).
4. Use comments to explain:
   - Why a particular approach was chosen over alternatives
   - Non-obvious edge cases or constraints
   - Complex algorithms or business logic
   - Temporary workarounds (with explanations of why they're needed)
5. Keep comments concise and focused on clarifying intent rather than implementation details.

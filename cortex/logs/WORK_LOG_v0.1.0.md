# Work Log - Version 0.1.0

## AI Instructions for Adding New Log Entries

*This section provides guidelines for AI assistants on how to add new entries to this work log. These instructions are preserved when creating new version logs.*

### Entry Format Requirements

**Header Format:**
- Use level 3 heading (`###`) with format: `YYYY-MM-DD - [Descriptive Title]`
- Date must be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Title should be concise but descriptive of the main work accomplished
- Add horizontal rule (`---`) before each entry

**Required Sections:**
1. **Summary:** Bulleted list of concrete accomplishments
   - Focus on what was actually implemented, created, or modified
   - Be specific about files, classes, interfaces, or modules affected
   - Include quantifiable details where relevant (e.g., "Added 5 test classes")

2. **Key Architectural Decisions:** Bulleted list of significant design choices
   - Document rationale behind major decisions
   - Reference design principles or patterns applied
   - Note any deviations from standard approaches and why
   - Use "N/A" if no significant architectural decisions were made

### Content Guidelines

**Writing Style:**
- Use past tense for completed actions
- Be factual and objective, avoid subjective language
- Focus on outcomes rather than process
- Keep entries concise but comprehensive

**Technical Details:**
- Reference specific interfaces, classes, and namespaces
- Mention adherence to [`DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) and [`REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md`](../REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md)
- Note use of community-standard libraries vs. custom implementations
- Document test coverage and quality assurance measures

**Cross-References:**
- Link to relevant documentation files using relative paths
- Reference specific line numbers when discussing code changes
- Mention related entries when work builds on previous sessions

### Entry Placement

- **Always add new entries at the top** of the "Development Log Entries" section
- Maintain reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Each entry should be separated by a horizontal rule (`---`)

## Development Log Entries (Reverse Chronological)

*Detailed entries documenting all development work, maintained in reverse chronological order.*

### 2025-07-10 - Source Code Pruned for Minimalism and Standards Alignment

**Summary:**
- Deleted all source and test files from the class library and test project to reset the codebase
- Removed all custom abstractions and implementations, including foundational, event, repository, and utility modules
- Retained only the design, workflow, and refactoring documentation to guide future development
- Preserved project structure and configuration files

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Adopted a minimal, documentation-driven starting point for the project
- Committed to using community-standard libraries and frameworks (see [`DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)) for all future implementations unless a clear need for custom code arises
- All future abstractions and implementations will be introduced only when justified by testability, swappability, or cross-cutting concerns

---

### 2025-07-09 - Repository, UnitOfWork, and Validator Test Audit & Documentation Enhancement

**Summary:**
- Reviewed and audited all test code for the `Repository`, `UnitOfWork`, and `Validator` abstractions, ensuring strict adherence to the project's design principles and refactoring checklist
- Confirmed that all test code mirrors the structure of the code under test, with each abstraction's tests and helpers in their own subdirectory under `Abstractions/`
- Verified that all test files contain only one public type, and that filenames match their types
- Added or updated detailed XML documentation and remarks to all test files, clarifying test isolation, design principle compliance, and test intent
- Ensured all test entities and in-memory implementations are clear, maintainable, and discoverable
- Confirmed that async/await patterns and cancellation tokens are used appropriately in test code

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Maintained a one-to-one mapping between test code structure and the code under test for maximum clarity and discoverability
- Used in-memory implementations for all abstractions to ensure test isolation and ease of replacement
- Required full XML documentation for all public/internal types and members in test code, in line with project standards

---

### 2025-07-09 - Event System Test Infrastructure and Quality Audit

**Summary:**
- Added a comprehensive test suite for the event system abstractions (`IEvent`, `IEventHandler<T>`, `IEventPublisher`)
- Implemented `TestEvent`, `TestEventHandler`, and `InMemoryEventPublisher` as isolated, single-responsibility types in the test project, each in its own file
- Created an integration test demonstrating event publishing and handling, with full XML documentation and strict adherence to design and refactoring principles
- Performed a quality audit of the new test code, confirming compliance with the project's checklist and principles

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Ensured all test types are single-responsibility, one public type per file, and fully documented
- Used in-memory publisher and handler registration for test isolation and replacement
- Confirmed thread safety and extensibility of the event system test infrastructure

---

### 2025-07-09 - Foundational Abstractions and Core Services Established

**Summary:**
- Implemented the full suite of foundational abstractions as defined in the [`LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md`](../LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md), including contracts for data persistence (`IRepository`, `IUnitOfWork`), security (`IPasswordHasher`, `IUniqueIdGenerator`), eventing (`IEventPublisher`), and more
- All abstractions are located in the `pawKitLib.Abstractions` namespace
- Implemented a robust, secure, and testable random data generation service centered around the `IRandomProvider` interface
- Included a default `CryptoRandomProvider` and a rich set of `RandomProviderExtensions` for common tasks like generating secure tokens, user-friendly codes, and passphrases
- Provided default, production-ready implementations for core services: `BcryptPasswordHasher`, `GuidIdGenerator`, and `SystemClock`

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Consolidated all library code into a single `pawKitLib` project for simplicity, using namespaces and folders for logical separation of concerns
- Affirmed the decision to abstract even fundamental .NET features (like `Guid.NewGuid()` and `RandomNumberGenerator`) to ensure complete testability of dependent services, documenting this rationale in the interface comments
- Designed the `IRandomProvider` to be a minimal interface, with all higher-level functionality (e.g., string generation, collection shuffling) provided via extension methods, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle
- Clarified the distinct responsibilities of `IUniqueIdGenerator` (for primary keys), `IPasswordHasher` (for user passwords), and `IRandomProvider` (for all other random data) through explicit documentation in the abstraction files

### 2025-07-06 - Architectural Design Finalization

**Summary:**
- Completed the initial architectural design phase
- Established the [`DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) as the project's "constitution"
- Finalized the [`LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md`](../LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md) to map out all modules and their responsibilities
- Designed core architecture built on dependency inversion and event-driven patterns to ensure all components are decoupled and replaceable

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- The `pawKitLib` library will be structured as a set of modular projects, each with a distinct responsibility (e.g., `pawKitLib.Abstractions`, `pawKitLib.Security.Core`)
- Added formal interaction model to the design principles to guide AI-assisted development, requiring proactive identification of abstractions

---

### 2025-07-05 - Workflow Prompt Refinement

**Summary:**
- Refined the `[Start New Version Session]` prompt in [`WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`](../WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md)
- Simplified the prompt and clarified its instructions to ensure consistent semantic versioning
- Added safeguards to prevent accidental modification of historical documents
- Established correct initialization process for clean work logs for new versions

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Established a clear policy for automated version bumps: target general project files (`.csproj`, `README.md`) while explicitly ignoring version-stamped documentation to preserve historical integrity

---

### 2025-07-05 - Cortex System Establishment

**Summary:**
- Established the `cortex` system for AI-assisted development
- Created the core files: [`DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md), [`REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md`](../REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md), [`WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`](../WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md), and the versioned work log structure
- Defined structured development workflow with clear phases and documentation requirements

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Structured the development process into two distinct phases: Implementation Session and Check & Refactor Session, each with its own logging template
- Established versioned work logs (e.g., `WORK_LOG_v0.1.0.md`) maintained in reverse-chronological order
- Refined the log format for check sessions to be a narrative, bulleted list summarizing the outcome of each check, rather than a simple checklist

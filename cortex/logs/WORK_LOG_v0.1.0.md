# Work Log - Version 0.1.0

### 1. Executive Summary

*This section is a high-level summary for quickly briefing an AI in a new conversation. Keep it concise.*

**Version Goal:** Implement the initial set of core utilities, starting with a robust logging module.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- (To be filled in as decisions are made)

**Current Status:** The `cortex` system for AI-assisted development has been established. Ready to begin implementation of the first feature.

#### 2025-07-06 - Architectural Design Finalization

**Summary:**
- Completed the initial architectural design phase.
- Established the `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` as the project's "constitution".
- Finalized the `LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md` to map out all modules and their responsibilities.
- The core architecture is built on dependency inversion and event-driven patterns to ensure all components are decoupled and replaceable.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- The `pawKitLib` library will be structured as a set of modular projects, each with a distinct responsibility (e.g., `pawKitLib.Abstractions`, `pawKitLib.Security.Core`).
- A formal interaction model was added to the design principles to guide AI-assisted development, requiring proactive identification of abstractions.

#### 2025-07-05 - Workflow Prompt Refinement

**Summary:**
- Refined the `[Start New Version Session]` prompt in `WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`.
- Simplified the prompt and clarified its instructions to ensure:
  - Consistent semantic versioning
  - Prevention of accidental modification of historical documents
  - Correct initialization of a clean work log for the new version

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Established a clear policy for automated version bumps:
  - Target general project files (`.csproj`, `README.md`).
  - Explicitly ignore version-stamped documentation to preserve historical integrity.

#### 2025-07-05 - Cortex System Establishment

**Summary:**
- Established the `cortex` system for AI-assisted development.
- Created the core files: `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`, `REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md`, `WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`, and the versioned work log structure.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- The development process is structured into two distinct phases:
  - Implementation Session
  - Check & Refactor Session
  - Each phase has its own logging template.
- Work logs are versioned (e.g., `WORK_LOG_v0.1.0.md`) and maintained in reverse-chronological order.
- The log format for check sessions was refined to be a narrative, bulleted list summarizing the outcome of each check, rather than a simple checklist.

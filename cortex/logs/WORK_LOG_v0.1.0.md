# Work Log - Version 0.1.0

## 1. Executive Summary

*This section is a high-level summary for quickly briefing an AI in a new conversation. Keep it concise.*

**Version Goal:** Implement the initial set of core utilities, starting with a robust logging module.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- (To be filled in as decisions are made)

**Current Status:** The `cortex` system for AI-assisted development has been established. Ready to begin implementation of the first feature.

## 2. Detailed Log Entries (Reverse Chronological)

### 2025-07-09 - Repository, UnitOfWork, and Validator Test Audit & Documentation Enhancement

**Summary:**
- Reviewed and audited all test code for the `Repository`, `UnitOfWork`, and `Validator` abstractions, ensuring strict adherence to the project's design principles and refactoring checklist.
- Confirmed that all test code mirrors the structure of the code under test, with each abstraction's tests and helpers in their own subdirectory under `Abstractions/`.
- Verified that all test files contain only one public type, and that filenames match their types.
- Added or updated detailed XML documentation and remarks to all test files, clarifying test isolation, design principle compliance, and test intent.
- Ensured all test entities and in-memory implementations are clear, maintainable, and discoverable.
- Confirmed that async/await patterns and cancellation tokens are used appropriately in test code.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Maintained a one-to-one mapping between test code structure and the code under test for maximum clarity and discoverability.
- Used in-memory implementations for all abstractions to ensure test isolation and ease of replacement.
- Required full XML documentation for all public/internal types and members in test code, in line with project standards.

### 2025-07-09 - Event System Test Infrastructure and Quality Audit

**Summary:**
- Added a comprehensive test suite for the event system abstractions (`IEvent`, `IEventHandler<T>`, `IEventPublisher`).
- Implemented `TestEvent`, `TestEventHandler`, and `InMemoryEventPublisher` as isolated, single-responsibility types in the test project, each in its own file.
- Created an integration test demonstrating event publishing and handling, with full XML documentation and strict adherence to design and refactoring principles.
- Performed a quality audit of the new test code, confirming compliance with the project's checklist and principles.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Ensured all test types are single-responsibility, one public type per file, and fully documented.
- Used in-memory publisher and handler registration for test isolation and replacement.
- Confirmed thread safety and extensibility of the event system test infrastructure.

### 2025-07-09 - Foundational Abstractions and Core Services Established

**Summary:**
- Implemented the full suite of foundational abstractions as defined in the blueprint, including contracts for data persistence (`IRepository`, `IUnitOfWork`), security (`IPasswordHasher`, `IUniqueIdGenerator`), eventing (`IEventPublisher`), and more. All abstractions are located in the `pawKitLib.Abstractions` namespace.
- Implemented a robust, secure, and testable random data generation service centered around the `IRandomProvider` interface. This includes a default `CryptoRandomProvider` and a rich set of `RandomProviderExtensions` for common tasks like generating secure tokens, user-friendly codes, and passphrases.
- Provided default, production-ready implementations for core services: `BcryptPasswordHasher`, `GuidIdGenerator`, and `SystemClock`.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Consolidated all library code into a single `pawKitLib` project for simplicity, using namespaces and folders for logical separation of concerns.
- Affirmed the decision to abstract even fundamental .NET features (like `Guid.NewGuid()` and `RandomNumberGenerator`) to ensure complete testability of dependent services, documenting this rationale in the interface comments.
- Designed the `IRandomProvider` to be a minimal interface, with all higher-level functionality (e.g., string generation, collection shuffling) provided via extension methods. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.
- Clarified the distinct responsibilities of `IUniqueIdGenerator` (for primary keys), `IPasswordHasher` (for user passwords), and `IRandomProvider` (for all other random data) through explicit documentation in the abstraction files.

### 2025-07-06 - Architectural Design Finalization

**Summary:**
- Completed the initial architectural design phase.
- Established the `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` as the project's "constitution".
- Finalized the `LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md` to map out all modules and their responsibilities.
- The core architecture is built on dependency inversion and event-driven patterns to ensure all components are decoupled and replaceable.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- The `pawKitLib` library will be structured as a set of modular projects, each with a distinct responsibility (e.g., `pawKitLib.Abstractions`, `pawKitLib.Security.Core`).
- A formal interaction model was added to the design principles to guide AI-assisted development, requiring proactive identification of abstractions.

### 2025-07-05 - Workflow Prompt Refinement

**Summary:**
- Refined the `[Start New Version Session]` prompt in `WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`.
- Simplified the prompt and clarified its instructions to ensure:
  - Consistent semantic versioning
  - Prevention of accidental modification of historical documents
  - Correct initialization of a clean work log for the new version

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Established a clear policy for automated version bumps:
  - Target general project files (`.csproj`, `README.md`).
  - Explicitly ignore version-stamped documentation to preserve historical integrity.

### 2025-07-05 - Cortex System Establishment

**Summary:**
- Established the `cortex` system for AI-assisted development.
- Created the core files: `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`, `REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md`, `WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`, and the versioned work log structure.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- The development process is structured into two distinct phases:
  - Implementation Session
  - Check & Refactor Session
  - Each phase has its own logging template.
- Work logs are versioned (e.g., `WORK_LOG_v0.1.0.md`) and maintained in reverse-chronological order.
- The log format for check sessions was refined to be a narrative, bulleted list summarizing the outcome of each check, rather than a simple checklist.

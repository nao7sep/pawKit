# Work Log - Version 0.1.0

## 1. Executive Summary

*This section is a high-level summary for quickly briefing an AI in a new conversation. Keep it concise.*

**Version Goal:** Implement the initial set of core utilities, starting with a robust logging module.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- (To be filled in as decisions are made)

**Current Status:** The `cortex` system for AI-assisted development has been established. Ready to begin implementation of the first feature.

## 2. Detailed Log Entries (Reverse Chronological)

*Add detailed entries below as work is completed.*

**Date:** 2025-07-06
**Summary:** Completed the initial architectural design phase. Established the `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` as the project's "constitution" and finalized the `LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md` to map out all modules and their responsibilities. The core architecture is built on dependency inversion and event-driven patterns to ensure all components are decoupled and replaceable.
**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- The `pawKitLib` library will be structured as a set of modular projects, each with a distinct responsibility (e.g., `pawKitLib.Abstractions`, `pawKitLib.Security.Core`).
- A formal interaction model was added to the design principles to guide AI-assisted development, requiring proactive identification of abstractions.

**Date:** 2025-07-05
**Summary:** Refined the `[Start New Version Session]` prompt in `WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`. The prompt was simplified and its instructions were clarified to ensure consistent semantic versioning, prevent accidental modification of historical documents, and correctly initialize a clean work log for the new version.
**Key Architectural Decisions:** Established a clear policy for automated version bumps: target general project files (`.csproj`, `README.md`) while explicitly ignoring version-stamped documentation to preserve historical integrity.

**Date:** 2025-07-05
**Summary:** Established the `cortex` system for AI-assisted development. This includes creating the core files: `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`, `REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md`, `WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`, and the versioned work log structure.
**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- The development process is structured into two distinct phases: an "Implementation Session" and a "Check & Refactor Session," each with its own logging template.
- Work logs are versioned (e.g., `WORK_LOG_v0.1.0.md`) and maintained in reverse-chronological order.
- The log format for check sessions was refined to be a narrative, bulleted list summarizing the outcome of each check, rather than a simple checklist.

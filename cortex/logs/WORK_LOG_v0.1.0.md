# Work Log - Version 0.1.0

## AI Instructions for Adding New Log Entries

*Instructions for AI assistants on how to add entries to this work log. These instructions are preserved when creating new version logs because you'll forget the format otherwise.*

### Entry Format Requirements

**Header Format:**
- Use level 3 heading (`###`) with format: `YYYY-MM-DD - [What Actually Got Done]`
- Date must be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) - this isn't rocket science
- Title should describe what was accomplished, not what was attempted
- Add horizontal rule (`---`) before each entry

**Required Sections:**
1. **Summary:** What actually got built, not what was discussed
   - Focus on concrete deliverables: files created, classes implemented, bugs fixed
   - Be specific about what changed - "refactored UserService" is useless
   - Include quantifiable details - "Added 5 test classes" not "improved test coverage"
   - No fluff about "exploring options" or "considering approaches"

2. **Key Architectural Decisions:** Design choices that matter
   - Document why you chose approach X over Y
   - Reference which design principles from [`FOUNDATIONS.md`](../FOUNDATIONS.md) were applied (or violated)
   - Note deviations from standards and justify them
   - Use "N/A" if no significant decisions were made (rare but honest)

### Content Guidelines

**Writing Style:**
- Past tense for completed work - if it's not done, don't log it
- Be factual and brutal - avoid diplomatic language
- Focus on outcomes, not the journey of discovery
- Keep entries dense with information, light on narrative

**Technical Details:**
- Reference specific interfaces, classes, and namespaces - be precise
- Mention adherence to design principles or document violations
- Note use of community standards vs. custom implementations
- Document test coverage - actual numbers, not feelings

**Cross-References:**
- Link to relevant files using relative paths
- Reference specific line numbers when discussing code changes
- Mention related entries when work builds on previous sessions

### Entry Placement

- **Always add new entries at the top** of the "Development Log Entries" section
- Maintain reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Each entry separated by horizontal rule (`---`)

### 2025-07-10 - Complete Cortex System Restructuring with Maximum Brutality

**Summary:**
- Eliminated [`LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md`](../LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md) - design debt that served no purpose
- Restructured [`DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) into 4 modular files: `FOUNDATIONS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `REFACTORING.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`
- Created [`COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md`](../COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md) with weaponized Ore-san brutality for English AI sessions
- Renamed and brutalized [`WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`](../WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md) → [`SESSION_COMMANDS.md`](../SESSION_COMMANDS.md)
- Updated [`README.md`](../README.md) as navigation hub for selective file loading with brutal workflow patterns
- Rewrote this work log with brutal honesty instead of corporate politeness
- Performed comprehensive audit of entire cortex directory - found multiple consistency failures that needed fixing
- Fixed BOM character encoding issues in [`SESSION_COMMANDS.md`](../SESSION_COMMANDS.md) and this work log - basic file hygiene apparently needed enforcement
- Updated cross-references to point to existing files instead of deleted ones - maintaining broken links is amateur hour
- Enhanced workflow patterns to include [`COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md`](../COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md) in all sessions - brutal AI responses now mandatory
- Added "Brutal AI Sessions" workflow pattern for consistent intellectual brutality
- Increased sarcasm levels in [`FOUNDATIONS.md`](../FOUNDATIONS.md) to match contempt level of other files - consistency in brutality matters

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Blueprint eliminated because AI can read existing code for context - maintaining design docs is waste
- Modular structure allows loading only relevant guidelines per session - surgical efficiency over comprehensive bloat
- Communication protocol enforces intellectual brutality - no more diplomatic hedging or cheerleading
- Session commands redesigned for direct action - no explanations for basic concepts
- Work log rewritten to document reality, not sanitized corporate narrative
- All workflow patterns now mandate loading COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md first - no more diplomatic AI responses allowed
- Cross-reference integrity enforced across all files - broken links indicate sloppy maintenance
- Tone consistency verified across all documents - every file now delivers maximum intellectual discomfort
- File encoding standardized - BOM characters eliminated because they're unnecessary complexity
- System integrity validated - the cortex now operates as cohesive brutal development environment

### 2025-07-10 - Work Log and Workflow Prompts Restructuring

**Summary:**
- Restructured [`WORK_LOG_v0.1.0.md`](WORK_LOG_v0.1.0.md) into AI Instructions and Development Log sections
- Analyzed existing log patterns to extract guidelines for AI assistants
- Removed Executive Summary section - redundant information serves no purpose
- Restructured [`WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`](../WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md) from multiple complex prompts to two essential commands
- Updated workflow prompts to reference embedded AI instructions instead of duplicating rules

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- AI Instructions section preserved across version logs to maintain consistency
- Centralized formatting guidelines in work log to eliminate duplication
- Simplified workflow to match actual usage: comprehensive sessions followed by summary
- Clean separation: work log contains instructions, workflow prompts contain commands
- Maintained reverse chronological order and standardized entry format

### 2025-07-10 - Source Code Purged for Standards Alignment

**Summary:**
- Deleted all source and test files from class library and test project
- Removed all custom abstractions and implementations - foundational, event, repository, utility modules eliminated
- Retained only design, workflow, and refactoring documentation
- Preserved project structure and configuration files

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Reset to minimal, documentation-driven starting point
- Committed to community-standard libraries per [`DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) - no custom code without justification
- Future abstractions introduced only when justified by testability, swappability, or cross-cutting concerns

---

### 2025-07-09 - Repository, UnitOfWork, and Validator Test Audit

**Summary:**
- Audited all test code for `Repository`, `UnitOfWork`, and `Validator` abstractions
- Confirmed test code mirrors structure of code under test
- Verified one public type per file with matching filenames
- Added XML documentation to all test files
- Ensured async/await patterns and cancellation tokens used appropriately

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- One-to-one mapping between test structure and code under test for discoverability
- In-memory implementations for test isolation
- Full XML documentation required for all public/internal types in test code

---

### 2025-07-09 - Event System Test Infrastructure

**Summary:**
- Added comprehensive test suite for event system abstractions (`IEvent`, `IEventHandler<T>`, `IEventPublisher`)
- Implemented `TestEvent`, `TestEventHandler`, and `InMemoryEventPublisher` as isolated types
- Created integration test demonstrating event publishing and handling
- Performed quality audit confirming compliance with design principles

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Single-responsibility test types, one per file, fully documented
- In-memory publisher and handler registration for test isolation
- Thread safety and extensibility confirmed for event system test infrastructure

---

### 2025-07-09 - Foundational Abstractions Implementation

**Summary:**
- Implemented foundational abstractions per [`LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md`](../LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md): data persistence (`IRepository`, `IUnitOfWork`), security (`IPasswordHasher`, `IUniqueIdGenerator`), eventing (`IEventPublisher`)
- All abstractions in `pawKitLib.Abstractions` namespace
- Implemented `IRandomProvider` interface with `CryptoRandomProvider` and `RandomProviderExtensions`
- Provided production implementations: `BcryptPasswordHasher`, `GuidIdGenerator`, `SystemClock`

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Single `pawKitLib` project with namespace/folder separation
- Abstracted .NET primitives (`Guid.NewGuid()`, `RandomNumberGenerator`) for complete testability
- `IRandomProvider` minimal interface with extension methods for Open/Closed Principle
- Clear responsibility separation: `IUniqueIdGenerator` (primary keys), `IPasswordHasher` (user passwords), `IRandomProvider` (other random data)

---

### 2025-07-06 - Architectural Design Finalization

**Summary:**
- Completed initial architectural design phase
- Established [`DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) as project constitution
- Finalized [`LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md`](../LIBRARY_BLUEPRINT.md) mapping modules and responsibilities
- Designed core architecture on dependency inversion and event-driven patterns

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- `pawKitLib` structured as modular projects with distinct responsibilities
- Added formal interaction model requiring proactive abstraction identification

---

### 2025-07-05 - Workflow Prompt Refinement

**Summary:**
- Refined `[Start New Version Session]` prompt in [`WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`](../WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md)
- Simplified prompt and clarified semantic versioning instructions
- Added safeguards preventing modification of historical documents
- Established initialization process for clean work logs

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Automated version bumps target general files (`.csproj`, `README.md`) while preserving version-stamped documentation

---

### 2025-07-05 - Cortex System Establishment

**Summary:**
- Established `cortex` system for AI-assisted development
- Created core files: [`DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md), [`REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md`](../REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md), [`WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md`](../WORKFLOW_PROMPTS.md), versioned work log structure
- Defined structured development workflow with documentation requirements

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Two-phase development: Implementation Session and Check & Refactor Session
- Versioned work logs maintained in reverse-chronological order
- Check session format as narrative bulleted list, not simple checklist

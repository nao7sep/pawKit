@* This component controls which page is shown based on the browser's address (URL). *@
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
    @* If the URL matches a page in your app, Blazor will show that page. *@
    <Found Context="routeData">
        @* RouteView displays the matched page, using your main layout (like a template for all pages). *@

        @* FocusOnNavigate helps with accessibility: when you go to a new page, it moves keyboard focus to the first <h1> heading. *@

    </Found>
    @* If the URL doesn't match any page, Blazor shows this "Not Found" section. *@
    <NotFound>
        @* PageTitle sets the browser tab title to "Not found". *@
        <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
        @* LayoutView uses your main layout and shows a friendly message. *@

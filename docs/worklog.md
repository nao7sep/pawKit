## [2025-05-18] Initial Specification Generation

**Context:**
- The design and requirements for pawKitLib were discussed and saved as a conversation log (file archived securely).
- The conversation was split into detailed topics, resulting in the creation of `specs/topics-and-details.md` as a table of contents, and 18 topic-specific specification documents in the `specs/` directory.

**Topics and Corresponding Documents:**

1. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - File: `specs/logging-infrastructure.md`
   - Minimal, configurable, dependency-free logging system for .NET, with optional adapters.
2. **Configuration and Settings Management**
   - File: `specs/configuration-and-settings-management.md`
   - Flexible, JSON-backed configuration with type conversion helpers and no ambient defaults.
3. **Type Conversion Utilities**
   - File: `specs/type-conversion-utilities.md`
   - Centralized helpers for converting between strings and common .NET types.
4. **Exception Management and Serialization**
   - File: `specs/exception-management-and-serialization.md`
   - Structured, thread-safe exception capture, filtering, and JSON serialization.
5. **Path and File System Safety**
   - File: `specs/path-and-file-system-safety.md`
   - Unified, cross-platform path abstraction and safe file/directory operations.
6. **Dynamic Data and Flexible Value Wrappers**
   - File: `specs/dynamic-data-and-flexible-value-wrappers.md`
   - Type-safe wrappers for dynamic, loosely-typed, or schema-less data.
7. **Exception Class Design and Usage**
   - File: `specs/exception-class-design-and-usage.md`
   - Guidelines for custom exception hierarchy and usage in pawKitLib.
8. **Process and Command Line Utilities**
   - File: `specs/process-and-command-line-utilities.md`
   - Cross-platform command line parsing and process utilities.
9. **String Manipulation and Formatting**
   - File: `specs/string-manipulation-and-formatting.md`
   - Centralized utilities for multi-line and content-aware string processing.
10. **Time Abstraction and Time Zone Handling**
    - File: `specs/time-abstraction-and-time-zone-handling.md`
    - Interfaces and helpers for UTC/local time, time zones, and testable clocks.
11. **Validation Framework**
    - File: `specs/validation-framework.md`
    - Fluent, testable validation engine with built-in and extensible rules.
12. **ID Generation**
    - File: `specs/id-generation.md`
    - Centralized, extensible utilities for generating and parsing unique IDs.
13. **Hashing Utilities**
    - File: `specs/hashing-utilities.md`
    - Purpose-driven, extensible APIs for hashing strings, files, and streams.
14. **Localization**
    - File: `specs/localization.md`
    - APIs for localizing strings/resources, dynamic language switching, and fallbacks.
15. **Namespace and Project Structure**
    - File: `specs/namespace-and-project-structure.md`
    - Defines namespaces, folder structure, and modularization strategy.
16. **Email Abstraction and Sending**
    - File: `specs/email-abstraction-and-sending.md`
    - Interface-driven email sending with dev/test implementations and no core dependencies.
17. **SQLite/EF Core as Pluggable Storage**
    - File: `specs/pluggable-storage-backends.md`
    - Optional, modular support for SQLite/EF Core as storage backends.
18. **WebAssembly/Blazor Support Policy**
    - File: `specs/webassembly-blazor-support-policy.md`
    - Policy and guidance for Wasm/Blazor compatibility and modularization.

**Note:**
- The order of topics matches the current `topics-and-details.md` and may change as topics are added or removed in the future.
- Each topic is covered in a dedicated specification file, ensuring no gaps from the original design conversation.
- Update this log with a new dated entry for future changes, additions, or major document revisions.

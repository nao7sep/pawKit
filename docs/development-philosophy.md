# Development Philosophy & Lessons Learned

## Why Work Logs and Task Lists Don’t Belong in the Repository

Software development is a process of constant change. Code, documentation, and even the goals themselves shift as new ideas are tested and old ones discarded. Attempting to maintain work logs or task lists within the repository only creates a trail of outdated, conflicting, and ultimately irrelevant records. These artifacts rarely reflect the true state of the project and can obscure what actually matters: the code and its evolution.

For genuine insight into what has changed, rely on your version control system. Git’s history and diff tools provide an objective, chronological account of every modification. If you ever need to understand what happened between releases, let the code and its diffs tell the story—no need for a running commentary.

## Tracking Progress and Learning from Failure

Progress is best measured by the code itself and the decisions that shaped it. Instead of duplicating effort with manual logs, focus on documenting major architectural choices, design pivots, and lessons learned in dedicated markdown files. These documents should capture the “why” behind your decisions, not the minutiae of daily activity.

When things go wrong, embrace the failure. Record what didn’t work and why, but do so in a way that informs future decisions rather than cataloging every misstep. The goal is to build a living archive of wisdom, not a museum of regrets.

## Lessons from Past Development Attempts

Rigid adherence to textbook design and obsessive consistency proved to be counterproductive. The pursuit of theoretical perfection led to wasted effort, brittle code, and a lack of adaptability. Real progress came only when flexibility and pragmatism were prioritized—when solutions were allowed to evolve with the problem space.

Don’t try to anticipate every possible requirement or model every API parameter up front. Build what you need, keep your designs extensible, and let actual needs drive further development. The best code is not the most consistent, but the most maintainable and responsive to change.

## Principles for Sustainable Development

- Use git for tracking changes and understanding history; let markdown docs capture the reasoning behind major decisions.
- Avoid granular work logs and task lists—they will only distract from the real work and quickly become obsolete.
- Document what matters: architectural shifts, design trade-offs, and hard-won lessons.
- Refactor often, adapt quickly, and don’t be afraid to abandon failed experiments.
- Value clarity, maintainability, and adaptability over rigid consistency or theoretical ideals.

## Closing Thoughts

This document is a reminder to my future self: focus on what moves the project forward, not on maintaining a perfect record of every step. Let the codebase and its history speak for themselves, and use documentation to capture the insights that will actually matter tomorrow. Adapt, learn, and keep moving.
